## Problem Statement:
We want to see if we can predict the price of an AirBnB in the New York City area. We are aiming at someone who owns an apartment in the 
New York City area. We will try to give them an estamated price based on the borough they live in and other factors. We will also give them
the errors with the model, as there are many factors we may not have such as their rent price.
